- Compare individual train/dev/test sets of all treebanks using klcpos3 (UD tools/klcpos3.pl TGTDISTRIB SRCDISTRIB, where a distribution file has tab-separated trigram, count, relcount).
- Compare numbers of OOV words.
- Compare nonprojectivity (and possibly other metrics, such as planarity).
- Compute LAS without punctuation for all treebanks. (This would make PROIEL more comparable with the others. But the results would not be comparable with other published results.)
